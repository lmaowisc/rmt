The **rmt** package implements the restricted mean time in favor (RMT-IF) of treatment approach to hierarchical

with user-specified restriction times. Sample size calculation routines are also available.

## Installation

Install **rmt** from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("rmt")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmaowisc/rmt")
```
