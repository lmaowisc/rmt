# rmt

The **rmt** package implements the restricted mean time in favor
(RMT-IF) of treatment approach to hierarchical composite endpoints (Mao
2022). With user-specified restriction times, one can estimate and make
inference on the over effect size as well as its components (Mao and
Wang 2023) . Sample size calculation routines are also available Mao
(2023a).

## Installation

Install **rmt** from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("rmt")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmaowisc/rmt")
```

## Examples

Here is a basic example.
